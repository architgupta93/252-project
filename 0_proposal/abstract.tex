\initial{B}\textbf{ranch divergence in GPGPUs has attracted a lot of interest in the computer architecture research community. Various solutions have been suggested to mitigate divergence in SIMD architectures. However, a lot of these branches are artifacts of mapping of an algorithm to a GPU and are not intrinsic to the algorithm. In this project, we will analyze the nature of branches that a GPU encounters and classify these branches according to their nature in the underlying algorithm. Most solutions rely on some assumptions regarding the nature of branches encountered by the GPU, which might not be entirely true if the extrinsic branches account for most of the performance degradation. If the performance loss due to extrinsicn branches is significant, we will explore different architectural solutions in GPUs to reduce the same.}
