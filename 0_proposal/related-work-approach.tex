Some of the major breakthroughs in identifying and resolving control divergence in GPUs has involved dynamic warps and reconvergence stacks\cite{dynamic-warps}. In order ot handle register files and lane aware warp scheduling, we have also seen multi-level scheduling schemes\cite{warp-scheduling}. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the approaches have tried to analyze or characterize the control flow based on the mapping of algorithms onto a GPU.
