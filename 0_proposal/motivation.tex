\par{Figure \ref{fig:bfs-kernel} shows a code snippet of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm from the PARBOIL Benchmark Suite. One can see that the actual algorithm involves only the \textit{visit\_node} function to be called for each node in the graph. However, in order to map the code to a GPU, additional control flow has been added.}

\par{If branches like these lead to signifincat performance degradation for data-parallel programs, we can develop hardware solutions for improving execution of these branches on a GPU which can, in turn, significantly improve the overall performance.}
