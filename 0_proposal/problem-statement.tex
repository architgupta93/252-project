\par{
This project studies the performance loss due to execution of scientific and general purpose data-parallel applications on GPUs, and attempts to propose architectural changes to the GPU to mitigate such losses if they are significant.}

\par{\textbf{Performance loss} is defined as the number of cycles added due to control flow in the parallel code as a result of mapping a non-graphical application on a Graphical Processing Unit. The project contains two distinct objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Characterizing performance losses}: To measure the performance loss in various representative algorithms of general-purpose data-parallel workloads by simulating its execution on a modern GPU architecture.  
\item \textbf{Propose architectural changes}: If collective losses turn out to be significant, then various architectural solutions can be explored which can potentially reduce them. The proposals will also be evaluated on timing characteristics or power consumption.
\end{itemize}
