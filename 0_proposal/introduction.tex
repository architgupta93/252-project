\par{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are increasingly used for scientific and other compute-intensive tasks. Owing to the availability of large number of parallel resources (shader pipelines), they can achieve orders of magnitude higher performance on certain data-parallel applications than a conventional CPU.

\par{
However, since the shader cores were not designed for general purpose computing, there is performance loss due to a significant amount of control flow. Additionally, unlike vector processors, most GPUs do not have tightly coupled scalar core(s). Hence, in order to map general or scientic problems on a GPU architecture, the scalar part of the program can be processed in either of the two ways: (1) the scalar part is executed on the CPU and the parallel part on the GPU; or (2) the scalar (serial) code is executed on the GPU as part of the execution kernel thereby under-utilizing the parallel hardware avaliable.
 
\par{
While the former method involves significant data movement (CPU and GPU have seperate memory sub-systems), the latter approach causes the inclusion of significant amount of control flow in existing kernels.}
