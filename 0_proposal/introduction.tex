\par{Graphics processor units are now being extensively used for scientific computation because of tha availability of a large number of parallel resources. However, since the shader cores were not originally designed for general purpose computing, they perform poorly on code with a significant amount of control flow.}

\par{Additionally, unlike vector processors, most GPUs do not have a tightly coupled scalar core. So, in order to map a general scientic problem to a GPU, the scalar part of the program can be processed in one of the two ways:}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Processing the scalar part of the program on the CPU and the parallel part on the GPU. 
	\item Serial code can be executed on the GPU as part of the execution kernel.
\end{enumerate} 

While the former method involves significant amount of data movement (owing to the fact that the CPU and GPU have seperate memory sub-systems, the latter approach causes the inclusion of a significant amount of control flow to the existing kernels.
